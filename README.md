# iOS App-WhatsThat

WhatsThat uses the Image Detection InceptionV3 machine learning model for detecting the object present in the image taken from the device Camera or Photo Library and displays the percentage confidence of the detected result. The app does not detect a person or multiple components in the captured image. This app is not always accurate but however serves as a useful tool to kickstart users with a basic understanding of Machine Learning and Image Detection.
